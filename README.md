# Amphibian
This plugin integrates the Droplet Editor into an IntelliJ IDEA Plugin. The Droplet Editor is also used in Pencil Code (http://pencilcode.net/) and some code.org exercises. Eventually, we hope to support all languages supported by Droplet and the various tools in the JetBrains IDE family. 

# Installation & Running
Amphibian can be installed like any other IntelliJ plugin through the plugin menu. It is also available on the JetBrains Plugin Repository (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15716-amphibian-editor).

# Other Projects Incorporated into Amphibian
Amphibian uses a custom variant of the Droplet Editor from Pencil Code (http://pencilcode.net).
