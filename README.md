# droplet_intellij
This plugin will implement the Droplet editor into IntelliJ, another example implementation of the Droplet editor is in PencilCode (http://pencilcode.net/). This plugin seeks to provide an interface to develop in all languages supported by various JetBrains IDEs within the Droplet editor. 

Over time there will be more languages implemented into Droplet for usage in these JetBrains IDEs, primarily including Java. I plan on eventually supporting every language in base IntelliJ IDEA (Java + Scala + Groovy + Kotlin). Beyond that as language support is added for JetBrains IDEs primary languages this plugin will be "ported" to those. (Ruby, PHP, possibly databases?)

droplet_intellij uses JxBrowser http://www.teamdev.com/jxbrowser, which is a proprietary software.
