# Amphibian
This plugin integrates the Droplet Editor into an IntelliJ IDEA Plugin. The Droplet Editor is also used in Pencil Code (http://pencilcode.net/) and some code.org exercises. Eventually, we hope to support all languages supported by Droplet and the various tools in the JetBrains IDE family. Prelimiary work to support Visual Studio is also completed. 

# Installation & Running
Amphibian can be installed like any other IntelliJ plugin through the plugin menu.

**NOTE**: Due to a flaw in the embedded web browser, Amphibian does not function correctly when the IDE is run in a Java version higher than 8.0 on High-DPI displays on some platforms. This can be addressed by changing the Java runtime for IntelliJ to Java 8. We currently are working to correct this by replacing the rendering engine in future versions.

# Other Projects Incorporated into Amphibian
Amphibian uses a custom variant of the Droplet Editor from Pencil Code (http://pencilcode.net).
